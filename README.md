# Covid-Tracker

Covid-19 has hit all of us. As a developer, I took the task to design a responsive website that shows the real-time data of covid-19 of over 180 countries using line and bar charts. The website also contains a card view that updates the user with the current number of infected, recovered, and deaths patients. I have also added a PWA feature which allows the user to save the apk file of the website on the home screen.
